    []How to Check if SEO/Social Tags are Working:

        Deploy Changes: Make sure you've pushed these changes to your live GitHub Pages site.

        Facebook Sharing Debugger:

            Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/

            Enter your portfolio URL (https://cruetto.github.io/PortfolioWebsite/).

            Click "Debug".

            It will show you the information Facebook sees (title, description, image) and any warnings or errors. It will also show a preview.

            If you update the tags, use the "Scrape Again" button, as Facebook caches this information.

        LinkedIn Post Inspector:

            Go to: https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/

            Enter your URL and click "Inspect".

            Similar to Facebook's tool, it shows the preview and data LinkedIn extracts.

        Other Tools: Search for "Open Graph Checker" or "Social Media Preview Tool" - many websites offer similar functionality.

        Manual Test: Share the link yourself on Facebook (you can set the post visibility to "Only Me" for testing) and see how the preview looks.
